# Pivot-ACMO
create single variable csv files from ACMO files.

To run in windows: 
1. Edit the pivot.bat file to include the path and version number of R on your computer.
2. Edit the Pivot-ACMO.r file to include the variables of interest to you, using headers in the ACMO file.
3. Put these two files (pivot.bat and Pivot-ACMO.r) and the ACMOs in the same directory.
4. Double-click on the pivot.bat file.

Read all comments in the Pivot-ACMO.r file for full documentation.
Number of files created = # variables selected x # ACMO files found in the current directory.
